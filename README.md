1. IBM Code adapted:
    - [X] retain original file names post conversions
    - [X] perform 16x, 8x & w/o downscaling (update immediately)
    - [X] only retain the unflitered and roi (black background) files
2. Create a code to pick each ROI and filename_01, filename_02, ... (segmentation)
    - [X] extract roi
3. Labelling
