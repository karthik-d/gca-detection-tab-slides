# GCA-Detection-TAB-Slides

Deep Neural Network to automate the detection of Giant Cell Arteritis from digital pathology slides of Temporal Artery Biopsy

1. IBM Code adapted:
    - [ ] retain original file names post conversions
    - [ ] perform 16x, 8x & w/o downscaling (update immediately)
    - [ ] only retain the unflitered and roi (black background) files
2. Create a code to pick each ROI and filename_01, filename_02, ... (segmentation)
